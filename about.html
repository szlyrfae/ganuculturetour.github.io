            <h2>T E R E N G G A N U</h2>
            <p>
                Terengganu is a coastal state located on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia,
                famous for its rich Malay heritage, traditional crafts, pristine beaches,
                and vibrant festivals. With its long stretch of coastline facing the South China Sea,
                the state is blessed with turquoise waters, white sandy beaches,
                and islands that are among the most beautiful in Southeast Asia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Known affectionately as “Ganu” by locals, Terengganu offers visitors a unique blend of history,
                culture, and natural beauty that reflects the soul of Malaysia. The state is deeply rooted
                in Malay traditions, where age-old customs are still practiced and celebrated. Its people
                are warm and welcoming, proud of their heritage, and eager to share their way of life with visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terengganu is renowned for its traditional crafts, particularly batik painting and songket weaving,
                which showcase intricate artistry passed down through generations. Local artisans continue to
                preserve these skills, producing vibrant textiles and designs that embody the cultural identity
                of the region. The state is also home to skilled boat builders, who craft traditional wooden
                vessels known as perahu and sampan, reflecting the community’s close connection to the sea.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond its crafts, Terengganu is a land of celebration and festivity. Colourful cultural festivals,
                annual events, and religious ceremonies fill the calendar, bringing communities together in joyous
                harmony. These occasions highlight traditional dances, music, and food, offering visitors a chance
                to immerse themselves in the rhythms and flavours of Malay culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nature lovers will find Terengganu equally captivating. The state boasts world-famous islands such
                as Pulau Redang, Pulau Perhentian, and Pulau Kapas, each offering crystal-clear waters, coral reefs,
                and abundant marine life. Inland, lush rainforests, rivers, and waterfalls provide opportunities for
                eco-adventures, while traditional fishing villages along the coast offer glimpses into a simpler, slower
                pace of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                From its heritage crafts and cultural festivals to its natural wonders and coastal charm, Terengganu is
                a destination where tradition and celebration come together. It is a place where the past and present
                coexist beautifully, inviting visitors to experience Malaysia’s cultural heart while enjoying the
                breathtaking landscapes that make Ganu truly unforgettable.
